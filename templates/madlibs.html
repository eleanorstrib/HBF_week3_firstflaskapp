        <p>There once was a l33t programmer named {{  MLname  }},<br />
            who had a {{  MLnoun  }} which was {{  MLadjective  }}. <br />
            Fortunately, this was not a problem.  Because the <br />
            instructor, who had a {{  MLcolor  }} nose, was <br />
            even more extremely {{  MLadjective  }}.</p>
