        <p>There once was a l33t programmer named {{  MLname  }},<br />
            who had {{  MLnum  }} cats and a dog. <br />
            Although many found her {{  MLadjective  }}, she was <br />
            better described as the {{  MLnoun  }}. <br />
            Fortunately, this was not a problem.  Because the <br />
            instructor, who had a {{  MLcolor  }} nose, was <br />
            even more extremely {{  MLadjective  }}.</p>
